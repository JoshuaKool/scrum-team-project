We are supposed to build an API that consists of multiple tables that can be used by the front-end team. The plan is to have 2 tables that contain houses and users respectively. For the houses table we add any collumns requested by the front-end team. We make sure that the users table is secure and works, an enum decides wether a user is a seller or a buyer. We will make sure the API works by making debug pages that allow us to debug the databse by adding, editing and removing any entries from the database. Everything should be ready to be merged with the front-ender's website.
